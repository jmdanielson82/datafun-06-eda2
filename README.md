Module 6 Project for Data Analytics 

## Project Overview
This project sets up a Python environment for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The goal is to create a reproducible workflow using GitHub, a virtual environment, and Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Setup
- Created a new GitHub repository and cloned it locally
- Added `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` using provided templates
- Committed and pushed initial project files

## Virtual Environment
A local Python virtual environment was created for this project.

Commands used:
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data
A public, non-sensitive dataset was added to the project under the `data/` folder.
The dataset will be used later for exploratory data analysis.

## Notes
This README will be updated as the project progresses.
